Embarking on My AI Security Learning Journey
Today marks the start of my deep dive into AI Security — a field at the intersection of technology, risk, and governance that is quickly becoming critical to our digital world.

As I begin this journey, I wanted to share some early insights and reflections on what I’ve learned so far.

Why AI Security Matters
AI is transforming the way we work, live, and make decisions. But as these systems become more powerful, so do the risks. Securing AI is essential to:

Enhance trust and reliability – ensuring AI systems operate as intended.

Protect sensitive data – safeguarding personal and confidential information from misuse or breaches.

Prevent attacks – defending against adversarial inputs, data poisoning, and other AI-specific threats.

Meet regulatory and compliance requirements – aligning with frameworks like the EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and data protection laws.

A Quick Primer: What Are AI and ML?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about creating systems that can perform tasks we associate with human intelligence — learning from experience, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

Historically, AI evolved from early computing experiments into Machine Learning (ML), fueled by the rise of big data. Unlike rule-based systems, ML models learn patterns from vast datasets, which unlocked breakthroughs in deep learning and neural networks. Today, we’re seeing rapid growth in generative AI and efforts toward ethical AI that integrates responsibly into society.

Key Concepts of AI
AI can be thought of as:
AI = Intelligence + Learning + Adaptation

Intelligence – reasoning, problem-solving, natural language processing, perception, decision-making.

Learning –

Supervised learning: models learn from labeled data.

Unsupervised learning: finding patterns in unlabeled data.

Reinforcement learning: learning through trial and error with feedback.

Common techniques include neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.

Adaptation – continuous learning, feedback loops, and transfer learning to improve over time.

Types and Applications of AI (with Real-World Examples)
Narrow AI – AI systems specialized for a specific task.
Examples: Google Translate for language translation; Spotify’s recommendation engine for music suggestions.

Generative AI – Creates new content based on patterns learned from data.
Examples: ChatGPT generating human-like text; DALL·E or Midjourney creating images from text prompts.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Understanding and generating human language.
Examples: Siri and Alexa for voice commands; Grammarly for grammar and style correction.

Computer Vision – Interpreting and analyzing visual data.
Examples: Tesla’s self-driving car vision systems; facial recognition for secure phone unlocking.

Reinforcement Learning – AI learns through trial and error with feedback.
Examples: DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeating world champions in Go; robotic arms learning to sort packages in Amazon warehouses.

The Road Ahead
AI offers incredible opportunities, but without proper security, these same capabilities can be exploited. My goal in this journey is to build a strong foundation in AI Security — understanding not only how AI works, but how to protect it against threats while ensuring compliance, ethics, and trust.

I’ll be sharing what I learn along the way, starting with the Practical DevSecOps Certified AI Security Professional course, which focuses on real-world AI security challenges and defenses.

If you’re also exploring AI or thinking about how to secure it, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.
